<<widget "farmland_manors_discovery">>
	The road passes through a pair of stone pillars, each tipped with a stone sphere. Overhanging trees flank it on either side, creating a tunnel. It looks wild, and rustic, but telltale signs suggest it's cultivated to look this way. It soon veers to the right, and down a hill.
	<br><br>

	You emerge in a small collection of buildings. They seem to be part of an old farm, but fancy-looking extensions, and fancier cars, <span class="green">suggest these are now the homes of rich people.</span> People who would sacrifice the amenities of Danube Street for privacy. People with something to hide.
