:: Farmland Manors Lock
<<set $outside to 0>><<effects>>

You approach one of the manors. Like many here, it used to be part of a farm. The walls are thick, the windows high, and the lock more sophisticated than it looks. A camera watches it, and there are others. Many eyes observing from foliage, or hidden in nooks among old stonework.
<br><br>

Imposing security. Less impressive is the lock on a gate, hidden behind a screen of plants and barbed wire.

You enter the manor and sneak around, looking for anything of value.

	The interior feels stuffy, and humid. Stains on the ceiling suggest mold, though it otherwise looks well-maintained.
	<br><br>
	You explore the manor, and find nothing unusual or valuable, until you stumble on a huge room, full of exotic plants. Windows make up most of the ceiling. It feels like a greenhouse.

	The walls are thick with gaudy decoration. Nothing looks valuable, or easy to carry. You peek into a room, and find a similar lack of taste.
	<br><br>

	You hear a snore from the room behind you. You peek around the corner. A <<person>> sits in an armchair, a valuable-looking gold chain around <<his>> neck, and a <span class="red">shotgun</span> resting against <<his>> knee.

	You open one door, and see a <<beasttype>> curled up beside a roaring fire, asleep. You pull the door shut without a sound, and look elsewhere.
	<br><br>
	You find two more <<beastsplural>> before you're done, but you manage to scrounge together some odds and ends. They look like they would be worth <<printmoney 15000>> to a fence, altogether.

	The rooms are empty. As if no one lives here. There are purple marks on the floor. Something heavy was dragged through. You hear a low thrumming from the basement.
	<br><br>
	You walk down the stairs without making a sound. A large, beetle-shaped machine sits in the centre of a decaying basement. You feel its thrum beneath your feet. Beside it, on a table, sits an open laptop.
	<br><br>
	You should be able to get <<printmoney 10000>> for the laptop on the black market. More if it has any valuable information on it.

	The walls look dilapidated, and a layer of dust is disturbed by each footfall. The rooms are empty, save the occasional piece of covered furniture. You find nothing you could carry away, until you reach a particular room on the second story. It's longer than the others, with a sheet covering the wall on the far side. You see the outline of something beneath it, like a painting, or mirror.
	<br><br>

	You approach it. You feel your hair stand on end. You touch the sheet, and pull it from the wall.
	<br><br>

	A portrait of a grotesque, inhuman face stares at you. Its jaws are open, revealing long fangs, but the eyes are most catching. One is an empty pit, dark stains reaching out across its cheek. The other contains a gemstone. It looks valuable.
