You enter the Serpent's maze. Tall, ivy-covered walls surround you, and shattered tiles litter the ground. Anything of value here was taken long ago, but perhaps something remains further in.

You come to a fork in the corridor, turning left and right. There's also a gate in front of you, sealed by a strange lock. On the wall beside it is a small message, written in red.

	The painting is old. It depicts a beautiful woman crawling out of the shed skin of a snake, as if it were her own skin just moments ago. She's holding a clutch of eggs to her chest, crying. The frame is intricately carved, shaped like a snake eating its own tail.
	<br><br>
	Part of the frame has burn marks and a small amount of water damage. There's a large cut on the main canvas.
