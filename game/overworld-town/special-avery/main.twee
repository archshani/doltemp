A sign details which rooms are on each floor. Yours seems to be at the very top. You step inside, and regard the set of gold buttons. You press the highest.

The ride takes longer than expected. The doors open, and you make your way to the room. You hesitate before sliding the key into the lock. There's a click, and you turn the handle.

The interior is spacious, just as fancy as the rest of the hotel. It's less a room, and more a suite, complete with a balcony and what looks like a hot tub. There's also a very large bed. You sit on it. It's so soft compared to those at the orphanage. You bounce on your <<bottom>>.

	You lean in, and you share a long passionate kiss. Your touch manages to calm Robin down almost immediately. <<takeKissVirginity "Robin" `($robinromance is 1?"loveInterest":"romantic")`>>

	"Thank you for saving me," you say.

	Robin smiles, <<his>> joy nearly bringing <<him>> to tears once more. You walk hand in hand back to the orphanage together. Robin holds you tightly the whole way.

"Fine," Avery snarls. "Go, then. Pretend this never happened."

<<He>> unlocks the car doors, allowing you to make your way out. You meet with Robin at the doors to the orphanage. Avery peels away from the curb.
<br><br>

"Your friend scares me like nothing else," Robin says. "But it was nice of <<him>> to bring us home."

The two of you walk into the orphanage. Robin seems relieved.

	<br><br>

	"This is far from over. We're going to have a long talk, you and I," Avery declares before finally driving away.

	You feel Robin clinging tightly to you as Avery makes <<his>> departure. "I was so scared," Robin says, now in a more relieved tone. "What does <<he>> really want with you?"

	Robin sighs in relief. "Your friend makes me really uneasy," <<person2>><<he>> says. "Where did the two of you meet?"

	You wisely decide to change the subject as you walk with Robin back to the orphanage, chatting along the way.

You approach Avery. <<He>> sneers when <<he>> sees you. "Do you mind? I'm waiting for someone."
<br><br>

<<if $speech_attitude is "meek" or $speech_attitude_avery>>
	"I'm sorry I disappointed you," you say. "I brought you this to make amends."
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
	"I was hoping for a fresh start," you say. "Here."
<<else>>
	"I regret how things went," you say. "I wanted to apologise."

<br><br>

You hold out the collectible card Landry gave you. Avery regards it a moment, <<his>> expression blank. Then <<he>> reaches out. There's a tremble in <<his>> hand.
<br><br>
A <<person2>><<person>> wearing a

<</if>>
emerges from the orphanage, and walks closer. Avery holds up <<person1>><<his>> hand. "Change of plans. You can go home." The <<person2>><<person>> stares at Avery, then at you, until Avery retrieves a wad of cash from <<person1>><<his>> car, and throws it at the newcomer.
<br><br>
Avery turns back to you.
<<if $avery_mansion>>
	"See you at the mansion."
<<else>>
	"I'll be in touch."
<</if>>
<<He>> climbs into <<his>> car, and drives away.
