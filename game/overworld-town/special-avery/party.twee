A servant walks up to Avery, and whispers in <<his>> ear. Avery whispers back, and the servant nods.

"I think the guests would rather dine out here," Avery says. A minute later, several servants arrive carrying a long table between them. It doesn't take long for them to get it set up beneath a gazebo, with all the cutlery and plates arranged as appropriate.

The party continues. Heads turn towards the entrance as Harper enters. <<person2>><<He>> approaches Avery.
<br><br>

"You have good taste," <<he>> says. "I've done my part."
<br>
Avery nods. "Good." <<person1>><<He>> makes eye contact with a servant, then raises <<his>> voice. "I believe dinner is ready. Come."

Avery leans closer as you turn to leave, and kisses your cheek. "Be sure to leave a good impression."

Harper remains silent as <<person2>><<he>> follows you up the staircase, then the next, until you arrive at the study. You unlock the door, and walk inside.
<br><br>

"Such rare titles," Harper says, rushing across the room. "Just like I heard, Avery's interests align with mine. Mind if I take notes?" <<He>> places the book, and <<his>> clipboard, on the desk.

Harper finishes taking notes, finds another book of interest, and repeats the process. <<He>> sometimes pulls a small camera from <<his>> pocket, and snaps a picture or two.
<br><br>
Once satisfied, <<he>> replaces the books, and puts <<his>> camera away. "Now then," <<he>> says in a lower, almost conspiratorial tone. "There's something I must prepare, while I have privacy." <<He>> puts on a latex glove, stretching it taut, then reaches into <<his>> coat pocket. <<He>> pulls a small pink crystal.
<br><br>
"This is a hazardous material," <<he>> warns. "It's inert for now, but if ground and ingested, it reacts with the human body." <<He>> dons a mask, and places another in front of you. "I need an assistant."

<br><br>

<<He>> places the crystal on the table, and taps it with the hammer. Nothing happens. <<He>> taps it again, and again, until a shard breaks off. <<He>> drops it in your mortar. You begin grinding it.

<br><br>

You grind for a moment longer. The crystals break down with little effort. "Here." Harper produces a glass phial, and holds it out. You tip in the powder, and <<he>> seals it with a cork, before holding it up to the light. "Very good work. Come. Avery must be anxious to have you by <<person1>><<his>> side again."

It doesn't take long to empty the bowls. The servants arrive to collect them. Some look tired, but Avery stirs them to attention. "The main course will soon arrive."

The guests are frozen in terror, their bodies sluggish from the sedative, but Harper looks on with fascination. Avery's expression is unreadable.

The three would-be victims pounce on the table, sending dishes flying around the room. The guests try to flee in panic, but the first three to do so are set upon by gnashing teeth and digging nails.
