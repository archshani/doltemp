You lift the glass protecting Avery's gold antiques. They're arranged in a row, dagger, amulet, and mask. The gold alone must be worth a lot, irrespective of their value as antiques.

There's nothing stopping you from taking them. However, Avery is sure to notice their absence.

You feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up as you walk down Danube Boulevard. A rustle from a nearby tree grabs your attention.

A figure drops out of it gracefully, but stumbles after a moment. It's the brown fox. <<He>> waves you over.
<br><br>

"<<if !$avery_mansion.fox.dungeon>>Listen. I've got a lead on the bones, but it cost me. <</if>>I'm compromised." <span class="red">There's some fresh bandages wrapped around <<his>> upper right leg. The centre is still dark with blood.</span>
From this close up, you also notice that what little of <<his>> face you can see is <span class="lewd">deeply flushed</span>. 
<<if Weather.temperature <= 5>>
	<<He>> breathes heavily, and you can see each breath in the cold air.
<<else>>
	<<He>> breathes heavily.
<</if>>
<br><br>

<<He>> notices you staring. "It's just a graze. It's not my first, and it won't be my last. The important thing is, the Elks only suspect a petty thief at work, and they've got no trail on me. Except that one." <<He>> points to the end of a faint blood trail.
<<He>> lets out a long breath, trying to compose <<himself>>. "The chase was exciting. Pardon my unprofessional look.
<<if $avery_mansion.fox.remy_warn>>
	It's thanks to you that I was able to give the High Elk the slip with only this."
<<else>>

<<He>> takes your arm and pulls you into a crouch behind the tree.

	"You're an accomplice now, whether you like it or not, so listen well. We're searching for a precious artefact. Landry at the pub can tell you more." <<He>> shivers.
<</if>>
<<if $avery_mansion.fox.dungeon>>
	"I'm certain that the dungeon you've told me about will have the vault. It will have a code, for certain. The problem will be getting in and finding it." <<He>> pauses. "I can think of one way. <span class="pink">If you make <<nnpc_him "Avery">> mad enough.</span>"
<<else>>
	"Somewhere in the mansion, there's going to be a vault, and that vault will have a code. I don't know where, but if I were to hazard a guess, it would be somewhere disgusting. A place Avery wouldn't want anyone seeing."
	<<He>> pauses. "Except <<nnpc_his "Avery">> favourite toy. <<if $avery_mansion.mickey>>Mickey already told you that, though.<</if>> There might be another way, if you can't stand being Avery's pet. <<nnpc_Hes "Avery">> deeply insecure." <<He>> swallows heavily.

<<He>> sits back, still breathing heavily. "It'll be dangerous if you decide to go that route. It'll probably hurt. Bad." <<He>> clutches <<his>> wounded leg and winces for a moment. "Worse than this, maybe." <<He>> tries to stand up.
"Unfortunately, I won't be able to help much more like this. I'm sorry."

		"You weren't meant to be that close to the bones when they activated. You weren't meant to be in the tower at all. I know their rituals. The Cannibal Fox changed it. <<nnpc_He "Harper">> knew something."
		<br><br>

		<<He>> lets out a dry, sad laugh. "<<nnpc_Hes "Harper">> still one step ahead of everyone else."
		<br><br>

		<<He>> sits back down.

		<<if $avery_mansion.fox.saved>>
			I'm glad I made it to you in time."
		<<elseif $avery_fate is "saved">>
			You didn't need my help, though." <<He>> leans forward into the light just enough for you to see <<his>> smile. "Your flight was beautiful, dear."
		<<else>>

		<</if>>
	<<case "apologyAccept">>
		<<He>> smiles and bows. "Your heart is a kind one."
	<<case "apologyDeny">>
		<<He>> frowns and nods. "As is your right. I failed in my part, and it cost you dearly. I only hope that, one day, you'll find it in your heart to forgive me."

		<</if>>
		<<He>> pours your drinks.
		<<if $avery_fate is "saved">>
			The two of you cheer, your glasses clinking together just a little louder than you had intended. You both wince, looking up the stairs towards the bedroom. No noise comes from it. The brown fox giggles, and you drink.
		<<else>>
			The two of you cheer, your glasses clinking together. You drink.
		<</if>>
		<br><br>

		<<He>> lets out a satisfied huff after downing <<his>> glass. "It tastes so much better with a partner, doesn't it?" <<note "+ ???" "green">>
	<<case "bonesReal">>
		<<if !$mansion_fox_followup.includes("bonesFake")>>
			"I suppose I owe you answers. I don't normally speak so freely." <<He>> paces.
		<</if>>
		"They're wrist bones. That's why they're called 'clutching bones.' They're very old. Preserved as a holy relic. Or an unholy one, depending on who you ask."
		<br><br>

		<<He>> turns to you. "Hold on to them. You're their keeper, now."
	<<case "bonesFake">>
		<<if !$mansion_fox_followup.includes("bonesReal")>>
			"I suppose I owe you answers. I don't normally speak so freely." <<He>> paces.
		<</if>>
		"They were the bones of a deceased whale, picked clean. It gave life to those at the bottom. It takes life back from those at the top just as easily."
		<br><br>

		<<He>> folds <<his>> hands in front of <<him>>. "I hollowed them out, and carved them into shape from photos that Landry had of the real ones. The rest was simple chemistry." <<His>> explanation is cold and clinical, lacking any sort of pride or emotion.
	<<case "thank">>
		<<He>> looks away. "It was my fault you were in that position to begin with. I don't deserve your thanks.
		<<if $avery_fate is "saved">>
			You alone saved Avery. No one else could have." <<He>> pauses. "And I don't think anyone else would have, if given the same choice. You are so... so very curious."
		<<else>>
			You saved yourself."
		<</if>>
	<<case "thank_how">>
		"I'm not sure what you mean. All I did was push you out of the way, and help you out of the debris."
	<<case "thank_saw">>
		<<He>> doesn't respond.
	<<case "AveryMad">>
		<<He>> looks down. "I'm sorry. The High Elk was the primary target, or so I thought. We inflicted a wound, but the outcome was... not as intended."
		<<He>> looks up to the moon. "Our conflict has only just begun. I hope you stay clear of it. You've done so much already. More than you know."
	<<case "Avery">>
		<<He>> looks down. "I did. The High Elk was the primary target, or so I thought."
		<br><br>
		<<if $avery_fate is "saved">>
			<<He>> lets out a long breath. "Perhaps, someday, redemption will find Avery." <<He>> looks up to the moon. "Our conflict has only just begun.
		<<else>>
			<<He>> lets out a long breath. "In a way, Avery is saved. Saved from something worse. What happened was a mercy. Weep not for the fallen." <<He>> looks up to the moon. "Our conflict has only just begun. Mourning must wait until the end.
		<</if>>
		I hope you stay clear of it. You've done so much already. More than you know."
	<<case "help">>
		<<He>> doesn't respond at first, only looking down and covering <<his>> mouth.

		<br><br>

		"Oh, my dear child." <<He>> hugs you. "You must have had a hard life, to give of yourself so willingly." <<He>> pulls back, smiling.
		"I'm still not used to working with others, but perhaps I've worked alone for too long. <span class="green">Some day soon, we will again.</span> I promise."
	<<case "mask">>
		You try to get a closer look at <<his>> face. Every time you do, it seems as though a cloud blocks the light of the moon just enough to obscure it.
		<br><br>

		"You're just going to give yourself eye strain doing that, dear." <<He>> dons <<his>> mask.
	<<case "piano">>
		"You know the melody, don't you?" <<He>> smiles. "Perhaps I'll share the words with you, some day."
	<<case "flirt">>

			<<if $avery_fate is "saved">>
				"I don't think Avery would like that very much."
				<<He>> leans in. "Perhaps I'll sneak in some day while <<nnpc_hes "Avery">> away." <<He>> places a finger under your chin. "Or maybe you should keep such thoughts to yourself." <<He>> smiles sweetly. <<glust>>
			<<else>>
				"I suppose you're open now that Avery's gone, aren't you?"
				<<He>> leans in. "Perhaps I'll come find you sooner that anticipated, for pleasure before business." <<He>> places a finger under your chin. "Or maybe you should keep such thoughts to yourself." <<He>> smiles sweetly. <<glust>>
			<</if>>
		<<else>>
			<<He>> giggles. "I'm flattered, dear, but I'm far too much for you."

	<<case "leave">>

			<<He>> dons <<his>> mask.
		<</if>>
		"How rude, not even saying hello."
		<br><br>

		<<He>> kicks off of the piano and lands right in front of you, <<his>> face still obscured by shadows. <<He>> places a finger under your chin. "Be a good <<girl>> and smell the roses, won't you?"
		<br><br>

		You try to move around <<him>>, but <<he>> keeps leaning in your way. You don't have much choice but to stay, for now.
	<<default>><<He>> sneezes cutely.
