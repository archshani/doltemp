"I know why you're here," Bailey says, running a hand through <<person2>><<his>> hair. "You want custody of this one."

"Correct," Avery says. "I'm suitable. A member of the community in good standing."
<br>
"It takes more than that to adopt one of mine."
<br>
"Of course. I'm sure there are background checks." Avery smiles. "But that's not the only reason I'm here. I'd also like to make a donation. To support the good work you do."

Bailey looks unimpressed. Avery retrieves a slip of paper from <<person1>><<his>> pocket, and slides it across the desk. It's blank, on this side. Bailey lifts a corner. <<person2>><<He>> peeks beneath.

Avery turns off Danube Street, and drives down a well-tended boulevard. The tall spruces are of a different species to those found in the nearby forest. They flit past the window, obscuring the unique homes behind them as the road twists up a hill.
<br><br>

Avery's mansion waits at the top. <<He>> doesn't slow as the filigree gates open, and drives into a tasteful garden, surrounded by tall walls. <<He>> continues into a garage, and parks beside a second car.

<<He>> kills the engine, and steps outside.

The door opens onto a spacious kitchen. Avery gestures as <<he>> gives you a breakdown of where to find each appliance. The surfaces are spotless, the machines state-of-the-art.

"The dining room is through here," <<he>> says, leading you beneath a wide arch. A row of tall windows dominate the far wall, letting ample natural light fall over a long dining table. You count eighteen seats.

The lounge is even more well-lit than the dining room, more spacious than the kitchen. Modern furniture and decorations are arranged in a tasteful, fashionable way, centred on a large screen hanging from one wall.

A sleek black piano sits tucked away in the corner of the room.

<<He>> stares at the piano as if it were about to come alive, but manages to tear <<his>> eyes away. <<He>> gestures at a door opposite the dining room.
"Through there is the display room." The interior is dark, but you spy a statuette on a plinth. "I keep valuable antiques there. Don't enter without a reason." <<He>> waves <<his>> hand, as if dismissing the room as unimportant.

"Let me show you our bedroom." <<He>> leads you into an atrium, lit by a skylight far above. An ornate staircase leads to the second story, which forks left and right. Avery turns left.

Avery's study is on the third story, and locked as well, but <<he>> doesn't offer you a key. The interior is small. A single desk, chair, and computer, surrounded by bookshelves on all sides. You follow Avery inside. You feel as if the tall, laden shelves are about to fall and crush you.
<br><br>

You're struck by an odd discrepancy between rooms. Most are modern, spacious and well-lit. Others, like this study, feel older, and enclosed. Small spaces tucked away, easily missed.

"I keep it locked for security," Avery says. "Some of the books have value. Just ask me if you want to read anything. I'll let you in."
