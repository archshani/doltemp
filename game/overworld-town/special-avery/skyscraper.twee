	You walk down the staircase. It spirals downwards, far enough that you must be underground. Remy and Harper follow close behind Avery, the latter's grin lit by the fell light.
	<br><br>
	The staircase emerges in a straight hallway. Red lights line the stone walls. At the far end stands an ornate door. "I've only shown this place to one other," Avery says, striding ahead ahead. "I might have been too hasty. They didn't last much longer." <<He>> pushes the door open with one hand.
	<br><br>
	Beyond is a wide room. In the centre stands two wooden boards, crossing each other in the shape of an X. Ropes hang and coil from the ends. A table sits beside it, holding a candle, various striking implements including a whip, and a bottle of red wine.
	<br><br>

Avery taps in the code, and the vault doors open. A purple smoke billows out. It clears enough to see a plinth, with a purple cushion on top. Sat on the cushion, <span @class="$fake_artefact is 'Avery' ? 'gold' : 'pink'">a white so pale.</span>

Avery approaches it, but Remy intervenes. <<person2>><<He>> snaps <<his>> glove into place, and appraises the wishing stones.

"It's not my first time in town," Remy says. <<person2>><<He>> taps the back of the driver's compartment. "Make it quick. We spent too long admiring Avery's furniture."

You can't see through the tainted windows, but you hear a commotion outside. Shouting. Threats. The driver accelerates, and the limousine lurches.

Avery waves thanks to many of them, until Quinn breaks rank, hands outstretched. <<He>> grasps Avery's in both.

The lift arrives at the top. The doors open.
<br><br>

Beyond is a room, large, but smaller than the one below. An array of tall windows sits opposite the lift, giving a good view of the town. A huge skylight hangs above. There's no artificial light at all. It's not needed. The room is bathed in the red of the moon.
<br><br>

The guests are here, wearing elk masks. All are kneeling, except Remy, who stands beneath the skylight, beside a table, holding a knife aloft. "You who would complete our triumvirate," <<person3>><<he>> says. "Must lose that which binds you." <<His>> voice sounds amplified. "Step forward."
<br><br>
Avery does so. Harper holds your arm to make sure you don't follow. "You've another role," <<person3>><<he>> whispers. <<He>> produces the purple box from <<his>> coat, and clicks it open. The wishing stones are still within. "When Remy calls for the stones, you must present this to Avery, then remain beneath the skylight until the ritual is done." <<He>> pushes the box into your hands. "No matter what happens."

Avery strides towards Remy. The elks begin an alien chant, rising in volume as Avery draws close. Remy points the knife at <<person1>><<him>>, then points at the ground to <<person2>><<his>> side. Avery stands beside Remy, and turns to face you.
<br><br>
Harper springs into motion, and hastens after Avery, stopping on Remy's other side. There's a mask in <<person3>><<his>> hands, in the shape of a hound's face.
<br><br>
Remy points the knife at you. "The stones."
<br><br>
You follow between the chanting elks, until you arrive before Avery, Remy and Harper.

Remy turns to Avery, and points the knife at <<person1>><<him>>. It almost kisses <<his>> throat. Then, Remy flicks <<person2>><<his>> wrist, spinning the knife and grasping it by the blade.
<br><br>

Avery takes the knife by the handle. As <<person1>><<he>> does, Harper puts the mask over <<his>> face. Everyone looks at Avery, but <<his>> fierce eyes are only for you.

The chanting fades, the room twists and warps. You're lying on a bed instead of the table. Avery still stands above you, <<his>> mask, and the knife, gone. <<He>> looks around, bewildered, seeing what you're seeing.
<br><br>

You're in a well-decorated interior, lying on a long chair. Two doors stand open, revealing a balcony. On it are two children, one helping the other climb up.
<br><br>

"Are you sure I won't get in trouble?" asks the second child as <<pshe>> stumbles onto the floor.

"Mum and Dad are out," says the first. <<His>> voice sends a shiver up your spine. "I visited your house. It's only fair you visit mine." <span class="red"><<He>> looks like Avery.</span> Neither <<he>> nor <<his>> friend pay you or Avery the slightest attention, as if you're not there.

"I told you I wasn't lying. I didn't want to take it out because I'm afraid of losing it."

The room distorts again, reforming into another with similar decor. Avery still stands beside you. Child Avery is here too, crying. In front of <<person1>><<him>> is an adult.

Avery falls limp, like <<his>> strings were cut. The elks fall silent. Then Avery pushes <<himself>> to <<his>> knees, then feet. Shaking, <<he>> rises.

A dome of green, like the hills outside the moor, surrounds you. Perhaps it's just <<his>> cloak.
Or perhaps it's the lack of fresh air, but even the red moonlight appears green for a fleeting moment.
