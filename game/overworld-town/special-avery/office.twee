You tap the keycard on the access reader and press the button for the top floor. It's not long before the elevator arrives at your destination. The floor is pristine, with luxurious decor, and the people who pass you by look just as grand. Feeling out of place, you hurry to the office number indicated on the note.
<br><br>
You stop in front of the office and knock on the door. With a click, it swings open to reveal the recipient of the envelope.

"You know, I do believe I have heard <<office_manager>> mention a skilled temp. I had no idea it was actually you."<<npcincr Avery love 1>><<glove>>

You walk into <<office_manager>>'s office to find <<him>> on a call. <<He>> hangs up the phone when <<he>> sees you, standing up to greet you.
<br><br>
"You're back! Thank you again for your help." <<He>> gives you a grateful smile. "I just spoke to the recipient of the letter. You must've made a good impression, since <<nnpc_he "Avery">> is interested in having you work for <<nnpc_him "Avery">> as <<nnpc_his "Avery">> personal assistant from time to time. The pay you'd receive would certainly be higher than your normal wages, but..." <<He>> hesitates, but simply shakes <<his>> head.
<br><br>
"It's up to you if you would like to work for <<nnpc_him "Avery">> or not. It's not a requirement by any means; you're free to take assignments from other offices as well."
<br><br>
You tell <<office_manager>> that you will consider the offer. "I understand, no need to rush." <<He>> nods. "Thank you again. Here, as a way of showing my appreciation." <<He>> pulls out <<his>> wallet and hands you <<moneyGain 50>>.
<br><br>
You take the money from <<him>>, and <<he>> puts <<his>> wallet away. "I won't keep you any longer then." <<He>> picks up the phone, and you leave the office.

It doesn't take you long to reach Avery's office.
<br><br>
You knock on the door. The door opens, and Avery smiles at you.
<br><br>
"I see you accepted my offer." <<He>> steps aside to let you in. Like the rest of the floor, the interior of <<his>> office looks quite opulent. Near the centre of the room is a grand desk with a high tech looking computer.
<br><br>
Avery sits in the expensive-looking chair behind <<his>> desk. "I was a little taken aback when I learned that you were working in my building." <<He>> clasps <<his>> hands and leans across <<his>> desk. "However, I realised that you working for me could be beneficial for both of us," <<he>> says with a smile.
<br><br>
<<if $speech_attitude is "meek">>
	You shuffle nervously. "Excuse me, but what does that mean?"
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
	You cross your arms. "Elaborate."
<<else>>
	You raise your brow. "How so?"
<</if>>
<br><br>
"Well," Avery continues, "I tend to work and mingle with individuals of a certain social standing. This could benefit you if you're trying to make a name in the business world." <<He>> waves a hand at you. "Moreover, you'll be learning the skills of the trade by working under me."

"I heard from <<office_manager>> that you're quite skilled at your job. I need someone like that at my side to make my work easier. Additionally..." <<He>> leans across <<his>> desk. "My job can be quite demanding, and having a 'distraction'..." <<He>> eyes your body up and down, making you feel naked. You blush slightly, and <<he>> chuckles. "...and one that's easy on the eyes as well, would be nice."
<br><br>
You ask what kinds of tasks <<he>> would make you do, and <<he>> waves <<his>> hand vaguely. "Mostly miscellaneous tasks. Grab coffee, make copies for me, organise paperwork, et cetera. Nothing too difficult, so I'm sure you can manage."
<br><br>
You clarify that you wanted to know what <<he>> meant by 'distraction'. <<He>> smirks. "There may be more opportunities for you to make some extra money. If you're smart enough, you'll take advantage of those opportunities if they come up."

	However, before you can ask more, you watch as Avery moves to examine <<his>> watch. Hinting to you that <<he>> had else to do. "As you can see... I am still technically on the clock. As much as I would love to explain more to you... I do need an answer from you now," <<he>> says, smiling. "Will you work for me now or not?"

Avery uses a keycard to swipe into a sleek-looking conference room. In the middle of the room is a small coffee table, surrounded by some leather seats. A <<generate2>><<person2>><<person>> and a <<generate3>><<person3>><<person>> are already sitting down.
<br><br>
Avery flashes <<person1>><<his>> most business-like smile. "It's good to see you both." You follow Avery as <<he>> approaches them and shakes their hands. "I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long."

From what you can gather, Avery is attempting to convince the <<person2>><<person>> and the <<person3>><<person>> to accept a deal, but the other party is hesitant.

Suddenly, Avery's phone goes off in the middle of the meeting. A brief look of annoyance crosses <<person1>><<his>> face, but <<he>> puts on a professional smile again. "My apologies, it seems that I have to take this call. I'll be right back." <<He>> leaves the room, phone to <<his>> ear.

"We need to make a decision today. We've pushed this deal off for far too long," the <<person2>><<person>> says.

"I don't know. I don't trust the look of that one. I think we can get a better deal elsewhere," the <<person3>><<person>> replies.

"I understand your reluctance," the <<person2>><<person>> says, "but I have heard good things about <<his>> work." The <<person3>><<person>> seems unconvinced.

It seems they may reject Avery's offer. You wonder if there's anything that you could say to convince them.
