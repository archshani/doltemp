"Great," <<he>> says. "Thanks. Come on in, they don't bite."

You enter the small house and meet the kids playing in the backroom. They're awfully young. The second one doesn't even talk. Their parent gives you a short speech before leaving.
<br><br>

"Here's my contact info, emergency only. Don't open the door for anyone but me. They don't need much, just for you to make sure they don't hurt themselves with the crayons or whatever. And please, for the love of God, don't swear in front of them."

"I'm not one to leave my kids to a stranger, but I'm in a tough spot right now," <<he>> adds, "and you seem okay. I trust you, you get me? Don't make me regret it."

Things go smoothly enough. They're too young to be troublesome. You just make sure they sing family-appropriate nursery rhymes and use the crayons on paper rather than each other's face.
<br><br>

Apparently, they're used to the <<personsimple>> leaving so abruptly, enough to not freak out at <<his>> absence. It must be hard. At least they still have one parent to take care of them.
<br><br>

Spending time with kids is oddly refreshing. You sing along with them and smile when they laugh. It's nice. <<lstress>><<stress -10>>

"They seem fine. You're a lifesaver. Here's your money, as promised," <<he>> says. "Did you... Oh, shame on me. I forgot to tell you, you could grab a snack from the fridge. Here, take this bonus. It's enough to buy yourself a coffee at this... Ocean Wind Restaurant, or whatever. Get home safely, okay?"

You accept the <<moneyGain 11>>. As you're leaving the house, you catch yourself hoping everything goes well for the little family.
