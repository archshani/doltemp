<br><br>

<<He>> sits down too. "The painting itself has significance in occult circles. It's titled <span class="gold">'Bleeding Ward'</span>.
It's at least sixty years old, potentially older. The red hues are known to churn and flow on the canvas when viewed from different angles.
The paint used in it has the curious property of appearing more saturated in dim light, while looking washed out and near-translucent in brighter light.
With the right setup, it can even appear to glow in the dark."
<br><br>

"Some believe the artist predicted the future in painting it.
A few years after it was given the public's eye, the moon began turning red more often than is normal, and with troubling consistency.
It caused... unusual behaviours in both people and animals. Officially, the cause is blamed on light pollution and atmospheric differences in our region.
The effects are simple mass hysteria. As for the figure depicted at the centre, <<person2>>no one can agree whether <<hes>> meant to represent the cause, the relief, or is simply a bystander."
<br><br>

<<person1>><<He>> scratches at <<his>> chin. "It does not hold value to me for any such extraordinary reasons.
I don't know who painted it or why. The truth is, I simply know the <<person2>><<personsimple>> depicted in it.
Or knew <<him>>, rather. <<He>> was a... friend. A good friend. This was my only physical memory of <<him>>."

The army practiced in the moor nearby, and the royal navy used our docks. They launched many ships that were used in the evacuations from the front lines, but it wasn't usually a military port. It was thought to be too small to be of any strategic importance."
<br><br>

<<He>> shifts around in <<his>> chair. "That, of course, proved to be false. We were hit hard in a surprise night raid. I still care for one of the old air raid sirens here.

You read off the names of family homes from memory. No one could have evacuated yet. You skip any homes that look untouched for now.

You have shelter just outside town. No potential targets anywhere nearby. It will be safe, but there's no way you can house everyone.

You hear a different door open. A moment passes, and you hear unsteady footsteps getting closer. Another moment passes, and it slowly opens.

			You ignore <<him>>, rushing the children forward to the bar. The man working the counter, the owner most likely, gives you an apologetic smile. You open your mouth to speak, but he cuts you off. "Sorry <<lass>>, not doing handouts. You'll have to pay just like everyone else."

			You nod in understanding, but after a moment's hesitation, he leans in closer. "But I'm willing to waive the cost if you get rid of that prick," he points to the drunkard that yelled at you, "Discreetly. People just want an ounce of normalcy after the shellshock."

"S-sorry, <<if $player.gender is "f">>miss<<else>>mister<</if>>! I... I thought you w... were..." she starts to sob.

After a moment, a large man answers. Behind him, a woman and a young boy. "Hello?"<br>
"Surname?" you ask.<br>
He looks at you unsure for a moment. "You first."<br>

He lets out a breath, but smiles. "Hope."<br>
"Important to hold onto," you say. You try to look behind him, but he shifts to block your vision.

You look up at him, dead in the eyes despite how much he towers over you. "I'm offering shelter to any children freshly orphaned, homeless, or unable to evacuate. I'm sure there's a reason you haven't yet."
<br><br>

He stares you down a moment, sizing you up. "Aye. My wife and I will be sticking around to help. Where are you taking them?"<br>
"A place just west of town, far away from anything that would be a target," you say. You quickly write down directions for him. He looks it over, thinking for a long moment.
<br><br>

Finally, he turns to his wife and son, kneeling down to his level. "You're going somewhere safe, alright?" The two embrace, the boy starting to tear up. You let them have their moment and say their goodbyes.

	You let the kids stop to catch their breath. You're nearly home.
	<br><br>

	Something crashes into your waist. It's Greene again, hugging your waist tightly and sobbing. "Y-you're... you're..." She can't get the words out. You gently pat her head.
	<br><br>

	"Can you be my new <<pmother>>?!" She suddenly cries out. The words alone nearly knock the wind out of you. You fail to find a response, and just hold her while she sobs. <<stress 50>><<gggstress>><<trauma -24>><<lltrauma>>

<br><br>

"The place we're going is nice," you say. "Just a little further now." Adams and Macleary sit together against some rubble. Hope kicks some rocks around idly. Winter stares transfixed at the hollowed out shell of a partially collapsed building.
<br><br>

"What are you doing over there? You're as stiff as ice," you say,<<if $phase is 1>> gently shaking Greene off and<</if>> walking over to <<him>>.<br>
"This will all be gone soon," <<he>> says. "They'll have to build something new."<br>
You nod.<br>
"I want to remember it like it was."<br>
"What do you mean?" you ask.
<br><br>

"This was a biiiig building once," <<he>> says, gesturing up with <<his>> arms. "I always like looking up at big buildings, they make me feel so small and safe. They might build something not so big here, and I want to remember what it was. So I'm staring at it really hard so I remember forever!"
<br><br>

"Sometimes remembering isn't all that great," you say. "Especially a situation like this."<br>
<<He>> shakes <<his>> head in protest. "I want to remember everything! If I picture it hard enough I can almost see it here!" <<He>> closes <<his>> eyes tightly, <<his>> tongue sticking out in concentration.
<br><br>

You shake your head and start to walk away. You're a good distance out when <span class="red">you hear the rubble shift.</span> Slowly, the building in front of Winter lurches towards <<him>> as the miniscule remaining support finally gives way. <<His>> eyes open.

	A dome of green, like the hills outside the moor, surrounded us. Maybe it was just the inside of <<pher>> clothes.

You slowly open your eyes. The light's much different. You must have been out for a while.
<br><br>

"About time," says a voice you don't recognise. You sit up fast, causing a sharp pain to shoot through your head. "Easy there." A pair of firm hands hold your shoulders. A <<person2>><<person>> in a police uniform greets you as your vision finally comes back into focus.
<br><br>

"Name?" <<he>> asks.<br>
"M-mother goose," you respond. <<He>> gives you a concerned glare.<br>

You quickly look around. The children are still here, all of them quickly getting up upon seeing you wake. Winter rushes over to you, collapsing into hugging you. <<person1>><<His>> tears wet your shirt.

You reach up to your head, and feel fresh bandages around the back.
<br><br>

"Forgive the first responders for the fast patch job, no time for triage, as I'm sure you understand. There's not enough shelter space for the injured, never mind everyone that lost a home, and most of that shelter isn't all that safe. Where were you taking these youngsters?"
<br><br>

"Just outside town to the west," you say, your voice hoarse. "Out of range of—"

"Yeah, yeah, good enough," <<person2>><<he>> says. "The Hope family said the same, just wanted to corroborate the story." <<He>> stands up with a groan. "I'll escort you the rest of the way. Let's go." <<He>> extends <<his>> hand to help you up.

You take it and stand up, leading the way. Winter clings to your hip the entire way there.

<br><br>

You push the front door open. "We're home," you say to everybody.
<br><br>

Winter takes a cautious first step forward. <<His>> mouth hangs open. Greene rushes past <<him>>, and immediately starts to make herself comfortable. Her laughter fills the air.
Adams and Macleary slowly step inside next. Adams still holds the baby close. You take them back, letting him finally relax.
Hope enters last, placing his little suitcase down.
<br><br>

You look down to Winter, <<his>> mouth still hanging open. "You'll catch a fly," you say. <<He>> snaps out of <<his>> reverie.<br>

You nod your head forward, letting the miserable-looking girl through the front door before tapping the rain from your umbrella.
<br><br>

"We're home," you say to everybody. Winter immediately stands up, runs to you, and hugs you, the force of which makes you take a step back.
You slowly return the embrace. <<stress 12>><<gstress>><<ltrauma>>
<br><br>

"This is Fisher," you say. "She'll be staying with us."<br>
The other kids all crowd around, giving their greetings.<br>
"Wow, are you really a fish?" Greene asks her.
<br><br>

Winter looks up to you, still clinging on. "How many more kids are you going to bring?" <<he>> asks.<br>
"As many as I can," you answer plainly. <br>
You look back to Fisher. She's finally smiling.

"I'm home—"

You're nearly tackled off your feet as Winter, Greene, Hope and Fisher all crash into you. The impact sends a jolt of pain through the back of your head where the debris had hit you. <<pain 5>><<stress 24>><<gpain>><<ggstress>><<lltrauma>>
<br><br>

Something taps you on the shoulder. Macleary holds her hands out, offering to take the bag with a smile. It's the widest smile you've seen from her yet, and Adams wears a matching one. You hand over the bag with a nod of thanks, allowing you to return the smaller childrens' embrace.
<br><br>

After a moment, you clear your throat, prompting them to finally break off. "Everyone, it's Hope's birthday today. His family gave us a cake to celebrate." Their eyes all fill with excitement. Some of the newer children look over. "There's enough for everyone." You nod to Macleary, and she brings the bag to the kitchen.
<br><br>

Hope starts to tear up. As usual. At least it's happy tears, this time. Greene hugs him tightly.

The home is filled with the sounds of celebration as everyone sings for him.

"I had a really bad dream," she says. "Can I sleep in here tonight? I don't feel safe in my room."<br>

You shake Mr. Hope's hand. His grip is firm, and he nearly shakes your whole body with his massive frame. "We owe you a great debt," he says. His son stands next to him, wiping his eyes. Greene holds his other hand.

The two of them break off, hugging you by the waist. "Thank you so much," they say. Hope starts to sob. As usual. Maybe that's all he had to do to convince his father to adopt Greene.

Her mother never turned up, but never appeared in any casualty reports either. At least she's going to a good home, with a good friend.
<br><br>

Mr. Hope digs around in his pockets, handing you a stack of notes. You don't bother counting it. "Just... give me something to remember them by," you request. He looks down to them.<br>
Hope removes his hat, holding it out to you. Greene does the same with her star-shaped hairpin.<br>

Adams and Macleary were taken in by a godparent last week. They gave you a mismatched pair of wool mittens to remember them by.
Fisher's older brother finally returned from military service, and took her back in. She gave you a rusty coin she found on the sidewalk a week prior to leaving.
That baby you found in the manor was taken by some government orderlies when it was determined they had no surviving family.

"You must be one of the brats <<if $player.gender is "m">>dad<<else>>mum<</if>> took in during the blitz," you say. "Winter... <<pshe>> talked about you all the time. An army brat now."

A silence hangs over the pub.<br>
"Sickness took <<phim>> a few years ago." You wave the bartender down for another drink. You see the look on Winter's face, and make it two.

<<He>> slides money of <<his>> own forward. "Please, allow me."<br>
"Oh, aren't you a sweetheart," you say with a smile as you ruffle <<his>> red hair.

More silence.

"You made <<phim>> very happy," you say. "Before me, <<pshe>> had bad luck having kids. You gave <<phim>> hope, and without that hope, I don't think I would have been born. When it was <<pher>> time, <<pshe>> had a smile on <<pher>> face."

"How rude of me for not asking this first. What's your name?" <<he>> finally asks.

"My own business," you answer. "If you have to call me something, call me 'the <<girl>> your mum warned you about.'" <<He>> lets out a small chuckle, but frowns.
<br><br>

You give <<him>> a side-eye, before you turn and lean towards <<him>>. "Oh, Lord, you're a mope. Drink a bit more and lighten up, will you?" You playfully punch <<him>> on the shoulder.
"Just like <<if $player.gender is "m">>dad<<else>>mum<</if>> said, you want to fill up that rattling skull of yours and remember everything. You just have to know all about me, yeah?"

You can't help yourself. After a few minutes, you peel your face off the bar and turn around, looking at the group. They're all talking and laughing, except <<him>>.
You focus and listen in.

"...and <<he>> couldn't stand the stuff for weeks!" Laughter. "All over <<his>> chest!" More laughter. Noise.
"What about you, Winter?" Your ears twitch. You listen more keenly for <<his>> voice. The other noises in the pub all fade away.
"Any luck with that minx over there? Looks like <<pshe>> could go like belt-fed mortar."

You avert your gaze quickly.<br>

	We kept in touch. I would visit <<phim>> frequently, and a relationship formed between us.
	<br><br>

	It was on and off. We understood that, due to my military service, we wouldn't walk the same paths in life.
	There were long stretches of time where we wouldn't see each other. But whenever I returned, our relationship would rekindle for a time.
	<br><br>

	Something about me being in the military seemed to bother <<phim>>.
	The stories of the bombings that <<pher>> <<pmother>> told <<phim>> likely left a bad impression.
	Still, <<pshe>> never said anything to me about it directly.
	<br><br>

	We left on good terms when I was transferred.

<br><br>

You hear the door's bell jingle. You look up, and a smile crosses your face automatically, despite the fact that this is the last person you were hoping to see on today of all days. Your head throbs. You already know what this is going to be about. "Winter!"
<br><br>

<<He>> approaches your counter, returning a much more sad smile. "Hey. I'll be leaving on a long trip soon. A... really long one. I'm just here to say goodbye."
<br><br>

Your smile quickly fades. "Wow, incredible Valentine's Day present," you say. "More army junk?"<br>
<<He>> shakes <<his>> head. "I've been transferred to the intelligence corps. I'm glad you mentioned that, actually. I know roses are cliché, but—"<br>
"Oh God, you didn't actually bring me flowers, did you?" you ask.<br>
<<He>> shuffles in place a bit. <<He>> slowly reveals a bouquet of roses. White and red.

<span class="narration">It felt... whole. Like everything was ending right when it was supposed to. We both had our own futures to worry about. Moreover, it felt like I had found something that was missing. Some sense of closure.</span>
<br><br>

"You idiot. You sappy idiot."
<<if $phase is 1>>
	You pull <<him>> into a hug.
<<else>>
	You lean in and kiss <<him>> on the cheek.
<</if>>
"Thank you." <<trauma -24>><<lltrauma>>
<br><br>

Neither of you need to say anything more about it. You both know this is going to be it. It was fun while it lasted, and it's not your first goodbye.
<br><br>

It still hurts.
<br><br>

It always hurts.
<br><br>

"I have something for you too, actually. I don't want you forgetting about me." You retreat into a side room, quickly returning with a rectangular object covered by a cloth.
<br><br>

"This was something of a vanity piece. A lot of people want their hands on it, though. You mentioned running the museum some day, and I was hoping this could be your first exhibit." You pull away the cloth.
<br><br>

Winter stares for a long moment. You can see the reflection of the red moon shimmering in <<his>> eyes. "Shameless," <<he>> finally says. "Fascinating work. It almost looks like the paint is moving." <<He>> stares for another minute. "They took some liberties with your hair, I see. Who'd you let paint you naked like that?"
<br><br>

"Friends," you respond, managing to both lie and evade the question at the same time. "If those hands of yours were any good for painting, I'd have let you do it too." You rest it against the counter. The two of you stare at each other.

You've never liked kissing. It carries emotions that eat you alive. <span @class="'pink ' + basicJitterCss()">Your tummy flutters.</span> This is a special occasion. <<arousal 5000>><<gggarousal>>
<br><br>

You let <<him>> pull you into a kiss. You intended for it to be quick. But you both hungrily go for another. And another. The first and last shared between you.
<br><br>

You separate. Then go in for another. "I'll miss my train," <<he>> says.
<br><br>

"Catch the next one." You grab <<him>> by the arms and drag <<him>> upstairs, to your bed.

	And that was it. I was gone for several years. When I finally returned, there was no trace of <<phim>>.
	I had hoped we would at least remain friends, but life rarely works out that way. I counted myself blessed for meeting <<phim>> at all.
	<br><br>

	I had brought the painting here to the museum before I left, for safekeeping. When I returned, it was gone too.
	As if it couldn't exist without <<phim>>. Only the frame was left behind. <<pHer>> one request to me was to display it here, and until now, I never got that chance.

You stand at the entrance. Your skull ripples with pain as you rest your head against the door. Your body shivers, demanding <<his>> warmth again.
The brief respite of <<his>> touch is nothing in the face of the abyssal hole in your chest, left by <<his>> absence.
<br><br>

<<Hes>> gone.
<br><br>

It always has to end this way.

You know this.

Just a little further now. The place you're going is nice.
<br><br>

The warmth changes. Burning. Yearning. The consequences of warmth fading away. Absence. Animosity. Back to warmth again. With every cold breath, the agonising change repeats.
<br><br>

You sit against a tree. The snow spreads its chill up your body.
<br><br>

You reach into your pocket. Your hands meet something cold. You pull it out by its chain. An ornate pocketwatch, the metal warped by heat. It ticks onwards regardless.
Your thumb rubs the snowflake etched into the glass.
<br><br>

A drop of water falls onto it. Another. They quickly freeze. The ice turns red as you stare.
<br><br>

The echo of <<his>> voice lingers in the air. You look up to the reddening twilight sky. Fresh tears streak your vision, and the thunder of <<his>> pounding heart slowly fades into memory.
<br><br>

A memory you'll never be able to outlive.
