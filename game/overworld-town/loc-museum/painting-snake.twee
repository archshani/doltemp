<span class="narration">
It's generally agreed upon that the event took place late in the 14th century.
The Cloister of Virgo, as they called themselves, held much control over the region.
<br><br>

This comes some years after a religious conflict that nearly spelled their annihilation.
Persecution was common, as they were eager to punish any they deemed guilty of having a hand in the conflict.
Or their descendants.
</span>
<br><br>

It's rarely quiet in the temple's dungeon, but when it is, it's deafening.
<br><br>

One thing that never fails to inspire instant silence is the reverberation of heavy boots on stone.
There's only one pair of boots in the whole faith heavy enough to make that specific dirge,
and only one bastard big enough to wear them.
<br><br>

You lean forward in your plain wooden chair, counting the footsteps. Only one pair.
That means he's alone, and thus probably here to yell at you.
You put your book down and brace yourself as the light of his torch begins to leak into the guardhouse.
The other gaolers all stand at attention. You don't bother. It's never made a difference with him.
<br><br>

His massive frame finally comes into view, along with his ugly brown-bearded face, marred with a lopsided handprint branding. An absolute wall of a man. The Bishop's Hand. He's carrying something over his shoulder. A long, limp sack, split at the bottom into two-
no, that's a person. His dark eyes scan the room, passing each guard, until his eyes land on you. He holds his torch out wordlessly.

There are many versions of this tale, but there are some constants across all of them.
The first of which is that the Bishop's Hand was a cruel, vicious enforcer.
<br><br>

Where the stories diverge depends on whether he was the exception, or the norm.
The wounds were still fresh. The Cloister's vengeance, swift and terrible. It inspired cruelty in many.

<</if>>
<br><br>

He nods towards the limp figure over his shoulder. "Fresh from the wall." His voice is a lecherous rumble, making the following belly laugh all the more unsettling. "Hounds enjoyed their meat."
He points forward, down the primary corridor. <<if $phase isnot 2>>You light the way forward.<<else>>The other guard lights the way forward, and you follow.<</if>>
<br><br>

One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Nine. He stops to think. Eight. Nine. Ten. Nine. He finally stops on the ninth cell. Only five of the cells you passed were even occupied.
You expertly find the right key on your key ring, unlocking the cell. <<if $phase is 2>>He shoves you in ahead of him<<else>>You enter ahead of him<</if>>.
<br><br>

He approaches the back wall, laying the new prisoner down. "You won't get much noise out of this one," he says as he secures her silver manacles to the wall by a chain. "No more singing for this birdie."
<br><br>

He turns to you, chuckling. Staring. As if waiting for you to speak out of turn.

Every spin on this tale, every divergence, comes from this man. Her personal gaoler.
His name is lost to time, but most sources point to him being a member of the old Fayne noble family.
A family with deep, historic ties to the cloister. It's probable that many of his brothers and sisters in worship were familial as well.

	You obediently ask for your orders. He gruffs under his breath. "Such a good dog, always ready to heel."
<</if>>
<br><br>

He removes a pouch from his waist, and draws a big cross on the wall in dark grey paste. He speaks as he works.
<br><br>

"She's a witch. Consorted with the Dark Elk and seduced the townsfolk. They're not happy about her being taken." He walks to the next wall and starts the second cross. "Ungrateful pigs."
<br><br>

He finishes the cross, moving to the third wall. "She's your responsibility. Personally. Too much of a contamination risk for more than one guard, which means you don't touch any other prisoners." He pauses to point at you. <span class="blue">"It also means you get sanctified whenever you enter or leave the dungeon."</span>
<br><br>

He finishes the last cross. "<span class="red">Make sure she lives, but hates every minute of it.</span> Bring her salvation through suffering. <span class="blue">Be here every day, at mid-day, for her penance.</span> Keep her intact until the red moon. <span class="red">If you show mercy, I'll assume she bewitched you.</span>" He pushes past you, <<if $phase is 2>>leaving with the other guard<<else>><<handheldon>>yanking the torch from your hands and leaving the cell<</if>>.

You take its hand. It's cold, and starts to pass through you. It floats forward, embracing you and vanishing. Something hangs around your neck.

	A pale arm separates from yours. A white tendril snakes along it, past the hand. It holds the tendril as you hold your whip. You have control of your arm again.
	"The arrow of time will be mere seconds from midnight. A distance your body cannot cross in time." The pale arm snaps the tendril. You snap your whip in the exact same way.
	"An extension of your body. Trust it, <span class="green">master it,</span> and distance will mean nothing."

Another step. Not far enough yet.<br>
Half of another step. Perfect.<br>
"At last, <span class="blue">strike at the silver that binds her.</span> Let your strike toll midnight."
<br><br>

You take four rapid steps forward, beginning a strike on the second.<br>
You shift your body weight perfectly, fully extending your arm and flicking your wrist. Time slows down.<br>
The smallest of adjustments. The tip of your whip just barely makes contact.<br>
The explosive snap shatters the branch into pieces, and echoes throughout the forest. <<prof whip 20>><<gggwhip>>

You explain everything in excruciating detail. You're not even meaning to. The words flow from your mouth against your will.

You're led to <<print $prisoner.name>>'s cell. The hand walks in with both of the suspects. <<print $prisoner.name.toUpperFirst()>> looks up, shying away.
<br><br>

"Witch," the Hand spits. "One of the faithful has been tainted by your touch."
<br><br>

She blinks at him, not seeming to understand him. However, her eye falls upon the monk on the right. Her stare is pointedly hateful. That's enough indication for the Hand.
<br><br>

He shoves the other monk out of the cell, into the waiting arms of the confessors. "You must be purified," they say. He seems relieved to only be facing the normal punishment.
<br><br>

The guilty monk sneers, struggling in the Hand's grasp. "This is an outrage. I should not be punished for bringing this whore closer to God!" He's silenced as the Hand punches him directly in the face, sending him to the ground.
<br><br>

The Hand crouches, looking him in the eyes as he clutches his bleeding nose. "You have transgressed, brother. You have either given the witch what she needs to invite the Dark Elk... or have taken that taint into yourself, without sanction, and have become a contamination risk." He rips a pouch from his belt, and dumps powder on the ground in front of the door.
"You will be the vessel for that taint. You will purge. You will repent, and be forgiven." He nods to you, signaling for you to approach.

You look at your prisoner. She eyes the monk angrily, her hands scraping against her shackles. The Hand licks his lips, and motions for you to unlock her shackles. You do so. She falls forwards, her hands digging into the stone as her grey eye pierces through the monk.
<br><br>

He tries to stand. In one swift motion, you unclasp your whip and lash him in the leg. He tumbles back down, and you give him a second lash for good measure.
<br><br>

He pushes himself back against the wall. "P-please, your grace, have mercy!"
<br><br>

The Hand laughs. "I'm not the one you should be asking." <<print $prisoner.name.toUpperFirst()>> drags herself forwards. You walk forwards with her.
<br><br>

The monk, the rapist, the defiler, the oathbreaker looks to you, pleading. Your fist clenches around the cord.

You do so, a few steps away from the altar. The silk-bearers do as well, but the rest of the procession files around you.

The altar is a solid rectangular slab of stone, intricately carved on the edges. Parts have been deformed by the elements.
The first two confessors to reach it affix a small silver blade to each lower corner, before walking to opposite ends.

The rest of the confessors slowly pass the altar in two lines, one for each side.
As they do, <span class="red">they run their hands along the blades.</span> They're held outstretched, dripping their blood onto the altar.

By the time every member has passed, the altar has become soaked in faithful blood. Finally, they form a circle around the clearing.
The Bishop motions for you to approach.

The silk-bearers walk with you to the altar, spreading the silk above you to shade it.

"Just a precaution, dear brother. You bear her taint, which makes you vulnerable." You're pulled into joining the circle.

"Unforgiven by act," you and your siblings continue.<br><br>

"Like overripe fruit of sin,"<br><br>

"Hark, by Virgo, our voices heard,"<br>
"Our Mending Rite enact,"<br><br>

"Pray, put an end to the Dark Elk's seduction,"<br>
"Purge now, this filth within."<br><br>

The silk-bearers nod to each other, and quickly pull away the cloth shielding the altar.
<br><br>

As soon as the red light touches her, <span class="red">she cries out.</span>

The antler erupts into a crackling rip in the air next to her head, as when you first saw it.

A few members of the flock look startled. Most are stoic. The Bishop nods to the Hand, who grows a sadistic smile and approaches with a large metal clamp.
He forcefully turns her right hand, and straps of leather join her restraints to force her hands open. He grabs one of her fingers in the clamp.

	Meanwhile, the cloister's persecution turned inwards. Following the ritual, a haze fell over the flock.
	It started when they were given direct orders by the Hand to never tell the gaoler what had happened that night.
	The veil of secrecy led to rumours and lies spreading and to be accepted as fact, and before long,
	hysteria led them to believe the witch was still here, her spirit possessing someone.
	Her visage creeped in shadowed corners, her hateful eye visible at the feet of beds.
	<br><br>

	The gaoler soon realised that his siblings were all in on the secret, speaking only in hushed whispers around him.
	He became isolated and obsessive, which only led his siblings to alienate him further.
	<<if $prisonerEvents.includes("talkHairBlooms")>>
		It all came to a head when he discovered a pair of flowers in his bed. The same flowers he had braided into her hair. It made him snap.
	<<else>>
		It drove him to insanity. He began to demand answers, his anger and paranoia ruling over him, until one day... he snapped.
	<</if>>
	He cursed all of his siblings one last time, before flying into a frenzy.
	He was eventually restrained, but only after injuring dozens. They say he fought as though possessed.
	<br><br>

	Indeed, they now had their scapegoat. Everything was blamed on the gaoler, supposedly possessed by the witch.
	His siblings saw her hatred in his eyes, and heard her cackle on his lips.
	Unfortunately for them, they might have been correct.
	Now whole of body, the dungeon would not hold the two of them a second time. They escaped as one entity, and fled.
	<br><br>

	She would begin a crusade of vengeance that some say lasts to this day,
	as she continually feeds on the uncertainty and doubt of the faithful, driving them to question and alienate their siblings
	until she can worm her way into their bodies, shedding her old flesh like a snake sheds its skin.
	<br><br>

	The Gaoler and the Hound. When a sinner's transgression was considered severe enough, they were to be thrown into a pit, where the beast and her master eagerly awaited to execute their perverse 'justice.'
	The Gaoler's whip and the Hound's claw raked contrition into the flesh of many.
	<br><br>

	For months, they were the terror of the region. Worshippers and laymen alike were given to the two for smaller and smaller crimes. Their names became feared.

Your hands tremble. Penance always fills you with desire. Not just you, either. Juices leak from <<= $prisoner.name.toUpperFirst()>>'s eager vagina. She craves this as much as you, if not more. Her eyes are locked with yours, full of hunger as her antler shimmers.

		Eventually, the seeds of their sins bore fruit.

		After many more months, the witch began to show the signs. Her belly swelled. The Gaoler's beloved Hound was treated as royalty, for a time.
		No one doubted that the gaoler was the father, but no one dared say it aloud. Regardless, their brief reign of terror came to a close.
		<br><br>

		The witch's broken body could not withstand childbirth. The moment she passed on, the manic haze of sadistic glee over the worshippers would fade, as if she had the whole flock bewitched.
		They were horrified at their own actions. The gaoler would take a vow of silence and spend the rest of his life repenting for his misdeeds.

		The child was cautiously raised by the temple, and despite their lineage, was made into a model servant of God.
		Or so they thought. In truth, the child became just as sadistic as their parents, and revelled in inflicting punishment when they came of age.
		<br><br>

		Legend has it, the witch left this world with a smile on her face, as if this was what she wanted. As if she inhabited the body of her own child.
		Now whole of body, she was free to make the descendants of those who wronged her suffer. Eventually, she is discovered, and once again thrown into a cell to face purification... only to seduce another worshipper, bear another child, and repeat the cycle all over again.
		Some say she still walks the earth to this day.
	<<else>>
		Eventually, her body could withstand no more corruption.

		She began to show signs of breakdown. The Gaoler's beloved Hound was treated as royalty, for a time.
		When the end drew near, the gaoler's final charge was to return her ashes to the soil of the forest.
		The moment it was done, it was as if a haze lifted from the flock.
		The sadistic glee faded, and the faithful became horrified at what they had been doing. As if they had all been bewitched.
		The gaoler would take a vow of silence and spend the rest of his life repenting for his misdeeds.
		<br><br>

		But that was not the end. Many years later, a freshly-inducted initiate began showing disturbingly similar tendencies.
		The haze returned, and the events repeated. A seduced worshipper, persecution, whip and claw. Again, and again.
		Some say the witch's spirit continues to haunt the faithful, tempting them with sadistic urges, or outright taking their bodies to continue her need to inflict suffering on the descendants of those who wronged her.

<<if $hcChallenge.forestItem>>
	There are numerous items piled up in a hoard of sorts, including several that must have been pilfered from the cloister, but that's not what catches your eye.
<</if>>
The deep green of the forest is stained with red. Blood. So much blood. Your heart catches in your chest.
<br><br>

Something looks up at you and whines. <span class="green">It's a baby.</span> A baby with tiny black antlers on her head, almost resembling twigs.
<br><br>

<<if $prisonerEvents.includesAny("sex", "elkspawnEmbrace")>>
	<<canvas-model-override "tears" 4>>
	Your knees crumble. You slowly place your hands around the baby, picking her up. You don't know how it's possible in such a short time, but there's no doubt in your heart. <<= $prisoner.name.toUpperFirst()>>'s hair. Your eyes. Her face. Your nose.

<</if>>
<br><br>

<<if $prisonerEvents.includes("talkHairBlooms")>>
	The <<personsimple>> lowers <<his>> head in respectful supplication.
<</if>>
You're flooded with guilt. You allowed this to happen. No. The <i>cloister</i> allowed this to happen. No faith, no sin can justify what happened here.
You hold the child closely. She embraces you happily. There is still a way you can redeem yourself, and your brothers.
<br><br>

<span class="narration">
	The child was taken in by the cloister as one of their own. The townsfolk were outraged upon hearing that their beloved wise woman was not only taken from them, but violated.
	Those more utilitarian members of the flock knew that raising the child was the only way they could stop the laymen from sparking a war. Most, however, did it out of duty.
	The gaoler cared for the child personally, taking a vow of pacifism and giving up the position of gaoler entirely.
	<br><br>

	He spearheaded many reforms in the faith, and would one day become high priest.
	He became a loving father, too. The dungeon was converted to living quarters and storage space.
	<br><br>

	The child was beloved by the flock, despite her unusual antlers. They considered it a reminder of their failure, and the redemption they desired.
	She was famed for her beauty and soft smile, which matched her mother's almost perfectly.
	<br><br>

	Indeed. Some believe that this child was no child at all, but simply the witch in a new body.
	Such rumours were always met with scowls of disbelief, but none could deny the resemblance once she came of age.
	She looked more like a twin than a daughter.
	<br><br>

	One day, she would simply vanish. The new high priest spared no expense searching for his <<if !$prisonerEvents.includesAny("sex", "elkspawnEmbrace")>>adopted <</if>>daughter.
	It spurred him on until his final days.
	<br><br>

	He would pass from this world with a smile on his face, though.
	<<if $prisonerEvents.includes("talkHairBlooms")>>
		A cloaked stranger had visited him on his deathbed, and braided two purple blooms into his hair. Perhaps he got a final goodbye after all.
	<<else>>
		Staring out a window at the forest. Some believe he saw her watching him from the edge, saying goodbye one final time.
	<</if>>
	<br><br>

	The constant search parties from the initial incident and throughout these years spurred a new tradition in the order,
	in which a monthly vigil is held for the lost. Many hoped to find some sense of closure, answers for what had really happened on the fateful night of the ritual.
	Some became obsessed.
	<br><br>

	To this day, there are some individuals that this story has a unique effect on.
	These individuals claim it's as though they themselves lived through the events in the gaoler's boots, their minds filling in details and gaps that don't exist in any accepted retelling.
	It's led to an infamy around the myth. The idea that the story itself is cursed by the witch's spirit, spiteful to any who have seen her suffer.
	<br><br>

	Thus, the Hopeless Cycle of <span class="teal">Desperation</span> repeats.

The clearing fills with the snapping of whips, the slashing of claws, the dull thuds of batons.
<br><br>

You both hold your own. You aim to disarm and disable.
A baton flies off into the forest as you strike the hand holding it.
A brother crawls away after being tripped. This is still your family.
<br><br>

She slashes at any that dare approach. A few small cuts won't kill anyone.
An injured hand raises against her no more.
A sister whose clothes fall to tatters tries to cover her shame, leaving her open to being tossed aside.
<br><br>

You both have the reach to cover each other. Her long arms ward off blows aimed for your side.
A quick strike from your whip stops an attack that would otherwise hit her head. A weapon once used to harm her, now being used to protect her.
<br><br>

<span class="green">You dance under the red moon as one, with whip and claw.</span>

The fighting has stopped. Most of the flock are disarmed, some lay unconscious on the ground. Those still able to fight stand paralysed.
<br><br>

You put an arm under <<= $prisoner.name>>'s back, lifting her until she stands. She immediately clings on to you.
<br><br>

<span class="red">"She's rupturing,"</span> comes the Bishop's voice.
"You may have damned yourself, brother, but you will not damn the rest of us."
He signals for the flock to flee the clearing. Frantic monks and nuns drag away the unconscious. It takes eight of them to drag the Hand away.
<br><br>

The Bishop shoots you a sharp glare. "The consequences will be yours alone to face. I hereby name you <span class="red">excommunicated.</span> May Virgo have mercy upon you."
<br><br>

Your heart sinks, and your fingers feel numb. The faith is all you've ever known.
His stern glare slowly turns into a smile as the clearing becomes empty.
"No one will interfere. Do what you must. You know your <span class="blue">burden</span>, gaoler. You knew it better than we."
He runs after the rest of the flock.
<br><br>

You look down to <<= $prisoner.name>>. Her eye is closed, and her breaths have become shallow. You know what you need to do.
<br><br>

There's still enough blood. You lay her down atop the altar again. There are some similarities between the Rites. You collect all the candles around the altar.
<br><br>

You hear a loud crack, followed by a groan of pain. A new hole is opening. The antlers can't grow anymore, so it tries to escape from her chest instead.
You hold a few of the candles down, dripping their wax onto her.
<br><br>

A blood-steeped altar. A blood-red moon. Fresh wax, to harden and bind. A tainted soul. A heart, so burdened. You begin the Rite of Encumbrance.

You drip the wax on your hands, and hold them over the candle's flames. <span class="red">A burn on each palm.</span> Another crack.
<br><br>

You hastily crawl on top of the altar with her. Her eye slowly opens.
<br><br>

She smiles. It's different, now. You suppose she was putting on something of an act before, but this one feels real.
Her arm weakly raises, trying to push you away. She looks resigned to her fate.
<br><br>

She looks just like she did when you tried washing her for the first time.
You wonder if part of her was trying to spare you this fate all the way back then, too.
<br><br>

She's not very strong. You can't force yourself on her, though. You tilt her head to look directly at you.
You ensure that she's looking right into your eyes, and lean down to kiss her. <<takeKissVirginity $prisoner.name "romantic">>
<br><br>

She looks shocked, not expecting you to take control like this. She weakly returns it.
You tell her that this is your choice.
Despite the fact that she's broken. Despite the fact that she was only using you for freedom.
Despite the fact that she's the embodiment of everything you've stood against your entire life.
<br><br>

Black ooze leaks from her eye, but she nods. You wipe it from her face.

<span class="red">Another crack.</span> She whimpers.

She's afraid.

You stop, and make her look at you again. You repeat what you said to her before you brought her outside.<br>

You tell her that she'll make it through this, and that once this is over, you'll still take care of her.<br>
You tell her that you won't leave her side.<br>

You tell her that your heart is hers. Tears run down her face, and she begins to sob as she holds you tightly.

Both of you. You stare down at her, at yourself. You anguish as you feel the suffocating confines of your broken body.
You shiver in rapture as you feel whole in yours.
<br><br>

You sigh in relief, in blissful exuberance, as the wounds of your vessels close, shutting away the corruption.
One is a bright burning torch of emptiness, and the other is the snuffer.
<br><br>

All too quickly, it ends. You're ripped back into your own body, and she to hers.
You yearn to go back, but the warmth of her embrace reminds you who and where you are.
<br><br>

You're only able to bask in the afterglow for a moment. You roll off of the altar, and immediately start retching.
Your body wants the corruption out, but you lie on sacred ground.
It will not escape. Not into the world, and not back into her. <<set $purity to 1>>

	And so, in this version of the tale, the gaoler earned the witch a second chance at life, one free of prosecution.
	It cost him much. His position, his family, his faith, his purity.
	<br><br>

	Burden-bound as the two were, he would also spend the rest of his days sharing in her suffering. She was still broken of body,
	unable to walk, and would never be able to care for herself. He knew this, and accepted his new charge with gusto.
	This was part of his duty. He was her gaoler. He would keep the world safe from her, and keep her safe from the world.
	<br><br>

	It was by no means an easy life, but they had each other.
	They lived secluded from the town, ensuring no one would fall prey to her supernatural beauty again.
	Her temptations were the gaoler's alone to withstand. Needless to say, he hardly minded.
	<br><br>

	As far as the cloister was concerned, they were both dead. The Bishop of the time made sure to push that narrative.
	Some believe this was a favour, a final thanks for ridding the cloister of the burdens brought on by the witch.
	The townsfolk were furious, but kept in line by the various noble houses of the area, who were each biding their time in a constant power struggle.
	Decades later, one such house would lead an insurrection against the cloister, but that's a story for another time.
	<br><br>

	Despite the differences between the gaoler and the witch, they both left their beliefs behind, finding something else to live for. Each other.
	She was his prisoner, but she found comfort in the cage. They would go on to raise a daughter, and live a happy life.
