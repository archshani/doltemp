You kneel down. She wears a dirty, bloodstained sack over most of her body. There are crude holes cut for her head and arms, with the legs going through what would be the top.
<br><br>

You shiver. Did she always exist in such filth? She huddles into herself as you approach. You flinch. It's the first time she's moved.

<br><br>

The other eye and her mouth are obscured behind dirty bandages. You stand perfectly still. She curls back in on herself. Once more, you approach, as quiet as you can now. She doesn't move, and her eye glazes back over. You examine her more closely. She's sickly, and what little skin you can see is very pale.

She's still mostly unresponsive. You won't get a better chance to get that dirty sack off of her.

Her silver manacles bind her hands in front of her, and the chain between them is attached to another chain, which itself is loosely bound to the wall.
They will make this difficult, but freeing her for even a moment could be dangerous.

You take a deep breath. Speaking with prisoners is usually forbidden. What's more, she's a witch, she could snatch your voice right from your throat!
<br><br>

You decide that it's still your best chance to get her to cooperate. You tell her that you're trying to help her, and that you need to remove her bandages to do so.
<br><br>

She stops squirming, her head moving to look at you again. "Hhh...hh..." She seems to try and say something, but she only lets out a whimper.
She doesn't seem to understand you, merely reacting to the tone of your voice. Like a hound.
<br><br>

Tricks to make her seem more vulnerable, no doubt. Still, it did get her to stop cowering so much.

Her left arm and hand look uninjured, and likely don't need to be re-bandaged. You wonder why they were to begin with.

You shake your head and focus. She's trying to bewitch you! The Bishop's Hand was right, she's dangerous.
Merely seeing her skin is enough to make one's mind vulnerable to her allures.
<br><br>

Her right arm is covered in deep bite marks. Human and beast alike.
Her legs, and especially her thighs, are the worst so far. They're covered in cuts and bruises, some very fresh.
You notice that, unlike with her arms, her legs were very easy to move.
The whore likely thought you meant to debase yourself and give in to her tricks.
<br><br>

Her midriff and ample breasts are lacerated and burned, but the area around her stomach is largely unharmed.
Her neck is covered in even more bite marks. All that's left are the bandages around her head.

Tufts of hair poke out from the bandages. You're not sure if it's naturally brown and red, or if it's simply caked in dirt and blood.

	You grip the bandages on her head and pull. She lets out a grunt of pain and tries to move away, to no avail.
	<br><br>

	As soon as you manage to pull the bandages away, they simply snap back into place. You try again. They pull back tightly to her head, especially on the left side of her forehead above her covered eye.
	<br><br>

	You try once more. <span class="red">Your hand suddenly feels cold.</span> More witchcraft? A few tears leak from her eye. It's no use. The bandages cling to her tightly. Are her facial wounds truly so terrible?

	The cloister calls it 'Saint's Crown,' and it was discovered on a nearby island. They're now grown in a raised section of the garden, covered in sloped wood.
	It's open on the east side and overshoots the garden itself, allowing it to catch the morning sun while shielding it from the rain.
	<br><br>

	Throughout their whole lifecycle, water must never touch the leaves. They must be watered directly to the roots in the dirt.
	Once 'ripe,' they're hung to dry for a month. When finally soaked in water, the leaves secrete their life's effort:
	a sticky, colourless ooze with an incredible ability to soothe burns. In the wild, this ooze is naturally and constantly secreted in thin, imperceptible amounts as the rains pass.

You do so. Your hands tingle. <<purity -3>><<lpurity>>

She holds them for a moment. You can't help but notice how ladylike they are. You thought a witch would have long, rough fingers with claw-like nails.
<br><br>

She slowly pulls your hands up, until they cover her mouth. Your whole body tingles for a moment. Suddenly, she coughs, and the tingling stops.

She looks at you apologetically before trying again. The feeling returns. She slowly pulls your hands away. Her mouth is open. <span class="green">A pair of flowers emerge from within.</span>

This couldn't possibly be why they labelled her a witch. She must be able to do more. You quickly suppose that anything more must require speech, but you're left wondering why she needed to take your hands.

The nuns helped you with your hair when you were an initiate, and taught you how to manage it. Now, you frequently help your sisters with their own hair. You turn her around and get to work. Her hair is no less unpleasant to touch than the rest of her body. <<purity -5>><<trauma 6>><<llpurity>><<gtrauma>>
<br><br>

You direct her hair away from the antler, and work it into a braid to keep it away. She relaxes in your touch.

She gently pulls it back and starts to give you a side braid of your own, although in a different style. She must be experienced, as she works fast.

You tell her that you let them feed on your purity in your sleep.

You gently braid her hair around the twin blooms. She runs her hand against them, smiling.

<</if>>

You return your whip to its clasp on your belt, before approaching her and crouching down to inspect her legs.
<br><br>

Slowly and carefully, you try to lift one. It provides no resistance. You let it go. It drops, coming to rest in a position that can't possibly be comfortable for her. Yet, she doesn't move it.
<br><br>

<span class="red">Terrible realisation overtakes you. You feel sick to your stomach.</span>
<br><br>

You back away, putting your hand against the wall for balance. She must have been born this way, or it was from some other misfortune. Your siblings couldn't have possibly done this. This isn't how the flock punishes. Despite that, a gnawing doubt grows. <<trauma 36>><<gggtrauma>>
<br><br>

Shame and guilt fill your chest. You shake it off. This changes nothing. Crippled or not, she remains a witch and a sinner who consorted with pure evil. Surely that's how she became this way, by her own misdeeds.
<br><br>

<<= $prisoner.name.toUpperFirst()>>'s grey eye glares at you, burning with anger and disgust. She doesn't seem to want your pity, either.

<br><br>

He slips the dagger under the bandages on her face. She goes still. With a swift motion, the bandages around her head all fall to the ground.
<br><br>

The Hand immediately drops her, backing away. "By Holy Virgo," he mutters under his breath. "She's no witch. She's a demon." You move to look at her face as she slowly pushes herself up off the ground.
<br><br>

You feel your stomach drop as your head starts to spin. You've read the scriptures, and heard the tales told in hushed whispers by older cloister members who lived through midnight. You never expected to see it yourself.
<br><br>

On the left side of her forehead is a black, splintering mark, as if the skin was made of cracked porcelain. It angles down, covering where her left eye would be, but doesn't stop. It escapes her skin entirely, ripping into the air and leaving a three-pronged crack, a <span class="tentacle">hole</span>, in the world itself next to her head. It moves with her as she recovers, no longer contained by the bandages. <<trauma 50>><<gggtrauma>><<awareness 50>><<ggawareness>>

The Hand towers over you. "Do not lose yourself. We must seal the room for confession and purging." He looks back to the confessor. "Purge her, before she ruptures."
<br><br>

<<= $prisoner.name.toUpperFirst()>> lays writhing on the ground, clutching her head. The confessor freezes, dropping the silver bowl.
It noisily clatters on the floor. "Y-your grace, she holds too much, I can't—"
<br><br>

The Hand looks back to you, squeezing your shoulders. "Brother Fayne. You are pure. You are strong. We leave this to you." He grabs the confessor and pushes past you, <span class="red">slamming the cell door shut</span>.

She stirs in the gloom behind you. You feel her gaze on your back. She <span class="tentacle">yearns</span>.
