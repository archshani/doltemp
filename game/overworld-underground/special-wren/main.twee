<br><br>
"There's a party tonight," Wren says. <<He>> taps the centre of the paper. "The person throwing it is rich and doesn't care who knows it.

You look around for Wren, but there's no sign of <<nnpc_him "Wren">>. A hand grabs you before you can go inside. Two large security guards flank you.

The guards don't spare you a glance as they usher you to the main party. There is a small, round stage set up in the centre of the room. All of the party-goers are mingling around it. Some glance your way. A few keep staring long past what's polite.
<br><br>
"Thank goodness," a <<generate3>><<person3>><<person>> says, rushing up to you. <<He>> looks frazzled. "I thought we were going to be without a dancer. Go on, hurry up! Everyone's waiting!"
