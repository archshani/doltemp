	/*Human Specific*/
	<<case "transfixed">>
		You stand over <<childname>>, and watch <<childhim>> sleep. You're transfixed by <<childhis>> chest, rising and fallen with gentle breaths.
	<<case "stroke">>
		You stand over <<childname>>, and watch <<childhim>> sleep. You find yourself stroking <<childhis>> head.
	<<case "yawn">>
		You stand over <<childname>>, and watch <<childhim>> sleep. <<childHe>> opens <<childhis>> mouth in a big yawn, and stretches.<<lstress>><<stress -6>>
	<<case "murmur">>
		You stand over <<childname>>, and watch <<childhim>> sleep. <<childHe>> murmurs and scrunches <<childhis>> features, as if having a bad dream.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
	<<case "cotNap">>
		You decide to have a nap, and lie in the bed beside <<childname>>.
		<br><br>
		You wake up sometime later with something wrapped around your finger. While still asleep, it seems that <<childname>>'s <<childhand>> was able to reach you.<<ltiredness>><<tiredness -3>>
	<<case "shiverInCot">>
		<<childname>> sleeps by <<childherself>>, shivering with every unconscious breath. You tuck <<childhim>> in with a nearby baby blanket. <<childHe>>'s soon sleeping peacefully.<<lstress>><<stress -6>>
	<<case "restlessSleep">>
		<<childname>> is restless in <<childhis>> sleep. You lie down beside <<childhim>>, and pull <<childhim>> against your chest. You hold <<childhim>> until <<childhe>> calms down. As you move to stand, <<childhe>> grasps your finger tight in <<childhis>> small hands. You snuggle for a while longer, before easing <<childhis>> hold on you and getting back to your feet.<<ltiredness>><<tiredness -6>><<llstress>><<stress -10>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
	<<case "waveTongue">>
		You smile down at <<childname>>. You wave your hands and stick your tongue out, making several different faces in an attempt to catch <<childhis>> attention. <<childHe>> studies your expressions with curiosity. <<childHe>> is trying to imitate you, but you're unsure if it's just a reflex.
	<<case "handsClap">>
		You bring <<childname>>'s feet to <<childhis>> hands, moving them around and occasionally clapping them together. You give <<childhis>> body a gentle massage, from <<childhis>> toes, to <<childhis>> back, then all the way to <<childhis>> fingertips. You shower <<childhis>> frame in affectionate touches. <<childHe>> smiles in response to your broad grin.
	<<case "peekaboo">>
		You cover your face with both hands, then uncover it a few seconds later. <<childname>> peers up at you. <<childHe>> smiles when your eyes meet.<<lstress>><<stress -6>>
	<<case "blowRaspberriesHappy">>
		You tickle <<childname>> and blow raspberries on <<childhis>> stomach. <<childHe>> responds by interrupting <<childhis>> cries, and laughs instead, flapping <<childhis>> arms and legs in joy.<<lstress>><<stress -6>>
	<<case "blowRaspberriesUpset">>
		You tickle <<childname>> and blow raspberries on <<childhis>> stomach. <<childHis>> cries become louder as <<childhe>> turns <<childhis>> head from side to side and squirms away. <<childHe>> seems upset over the treatment.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
	<<case "faceStudy">>
		You get closer to <<childname>>, so <<childhe>> can study your face and its features. <<childHe>> stops crying for a moment, only to grab your hair and pull it.<<gpain>><<pain 4>>
	<<case "rockToSleep">>
		You scoop the <<childtype>> up in your arms and walk while gently rocking <<childhim>> side to side and humming softly. Soon <<childhe>> calms down and falls fast asleep in your arms. You gingerly lay <<childhim>> down in the cot to rest. <<lstress>><<stress -5>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
	<<case "holdToShoulder">>
		You lift the <<childtype>>. <<childHe>> seems to realise your intent, and wraps <<childhis>> <<childhands>> around your neck while leaning on your shoulder. You bob <<childhim>> up to down, until <<childhe>> falls asleep in your arms.<<lstress>><<stress -5>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
	<<case "melodicLullaby">>
		You scoop up the <<childtype>>. You hum a melodic lullaby, rubbing <<childname>>'s back as you gently sway to the tune. The familiarity of your voice seems to soothe <<childhis>> mood. <<childHe>> coos at you.<<ltrauma>><<lstress>><<trauma -6>><<stress -6>>
	<<case "foreheadKiss">>
		You scoop up the <<childtype>>. You place a soft kiss on <<childhis>> forehead, and give <<childhim>> as much skin-to-skin contact as you can. The action encourages <<childhim>> to lift <<childhis>> head and reward you with a smile.<<ltrauma>><<lstress>><<trauma -6>><<stress -6>>
	<<case "objectShow">>
		You scoop up the <<childtype>>. You give <<childname>> a few different objects to look at. You explain the colours, shapes, and textures of things that you see around you. <<childHe>> reaches out to touch, curious to explore <<childhis>> environment. You make sure <<childhe>> doesn't try to grasp anything too heavy or awkward.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
	<<case "carryRevolt">>
		You scoop up the <<childtype>>. <<childHe>> revolts against being carried, and <<childhe>> kicks <<childhis>> legs. The longer you hold <<childhim>>, the more intense <<childhis>> cries become. Some of <<childhis>> kicks connect.<<gpain>><<gstress>><<pain 4>><<stress 6>>
	<<case "nurseryRhymes">>
		You recite a few nursery rhymes you remember from long ago. <<childHe>> looks alert as <<childhe>> listens to your voice. You make a few different tones and wait for <<childhis>> reaction. It seems to you like <<childhe>> recognises certain sounds and changes <<childhis>> expression accordingly. After a few more moments, <<childhe>> breaks eye contact and sucks on <<childhis>> thumb.
	<<case "FeetCup">>
		You gently cup <<childname>>'s right foot and count <<childhis>> toes, wriggling them before moving on to <<childhis>> next foot. <<childHe>> quiets, watching you with wide eyes as you move your finger from one toe to the next.
	<<case "shareThoughts">>
		You chat to <<childname>>, sharing your thoughts and waiting for a response. <<childHe>> doesn't seem to be paying much attention however.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
	<<case "speakCry">>
		You speak to your baby, but <<childhis>> cries drown your words. <<childHis>> face turns a deeper shade of red with every minute you spend trying to talk to <<childhim>>.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
	<<case "smilesAndLaughs">>
		You take <<childname>> in your arms, hoisting <<childhim>> to eye-level. The <<childtype>> is wide-eyed at the change at first, but then smiles and laughs. You repeat this several times, and soon have <<childhim>> laughing so hard that you can't help but smile yourself.<<llstress>><<stress -12>>
	<<case "talking">>
		You side beside <<childname>>, and begin to converse with <<childhim>>. <<childHe>> gives no indication of understanding you, but smiles at your presence and seems excited by your voice. Soon enough however, <<childhe>> becomes distracted by <<childhis>> own hands and falls silent. You get back on your feet.<<lstress>><<stress -6>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "thumbSucking">>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.talking++>>
	<<case "talking2">>
		You sit beside <<childname>>, and begin to converse with <<childhim>>. <<childHe>> gives no indication of understanding you, but smiles at your presence and tries to mimic your sounds. <<childHe>> soon becomes distracted by <<childhis>> hands however, and falls silent. You get back on your feet.<<llstress>><<stress -12>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "thumbSucking">>
	<<case "batheGentle">>
		<<wearProp "rag" "white">>
		You fill a small tub with warm water, and prepare the towels and a new nappy beforehand. You take <<childname>> in your arms gently, and carry <<childhim>> to the bathtub, making sure to put <<childhim>> in a safe position.
		<br><br>
		Next, you rub <<childname>> gently with the warm water, making sure to clean between the folds of skin, and holding <<childhis>> little body with one hand. The softness of <<childhis>> skin as you rub makes you feel extremely at ease. The baby seems to be tickled by your touches, and swings <<childhis>> legs in the water, making some of it splash on your clothes and face. You can't help but smile at the situation.<<ltrauma>><<trauma -6>>
		<br><br>
		You finish bathing <<childhim>>, lay <<childhim>> on a towel, and dry <<childhis>> body with softer fabric. You finish by changing <<childhis>> nappy and putting <<childhim>> back in <<childhis>> crib.
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
	<<case "batheShampoo">>
		<<wearProp "soap">>
		You fill a small tub with warm water, and prepare the towels and a new nappy beforehand. You take <<childname>> in your arms gently, and carry <<childhim>> to the bathtub, making sure to put <<childhim>> in a safe position.
		<br><br>
		Next, you gently rub <<childname>>'s head in circular motions with a handful of baby shampoo. The sweet aroma of strawberry fills the ambient, and bubbles begin to appear in the water. Your child seems curious, and periodically takes one of <<childhis>> fingers to the bubbles, popping them. <<childHis>> mellow laughter echoes through the room as <<childhe>> is distracted by the foam in the bathtub.<<ltrauma>><<lstress>><<trauma -6>><<stress -6>>
		<br><br>
		You finish bathing <<childhim>>, lay <<childhim>> on a towel, and dry <<childhis>> body with softer fabric. You finish by changing <<childhis>> nappy and putting <<childhim>> back in <<childhis>> crib.
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>

		You fill a small tub with warm water, and prepare the towels and a new nappy beforehand. You take <<childname>> in your arms gently, and carry <<childhim>> to the bathtub, making sure to put <<childhim>> in a safe position.
		<br><br>
		Next, you start the bath by trying to soap your baby's body. <<childHe>> doesn't seem to like the feel of water on <<childhis>> skin, let alone seems to be enjoying your attempts to cleanse <<childhim>>. <<childname>> threatens to cry as you continue the bath, but you manage to calm <<childhim>> down after a little effort. <<childHe>> pouts in distaste until the end of the cleaning session. When you're finished, <<childhe>> doesn't seem to want to let you carry <<childhim>> back, and makes uncontent sounds when you pick <<childhim>> up.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
		<br><br>
		You finish bathing <<childhim>>, lay <<childhim>> on a towel, and dry <<childhis>> body with softer fabric. You finish by changing <<childhis>> nappy and putting <<childhim>> back in <<childhis>> crib.
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
	<<case "batheTantrum">>
		<<wearProp "rag" "white">>
		You fill a small tub with warm water, and prepare the towels and a new nappy beforehand. You take <<childname>> in your arms gently, and carry <<childhim>> to the bathtub, making sure to put <<childhim>> in a safe position.
		<br><br>
		Just touching the water makes <<childname>> let out a high-pitched, incessant cry. <<childHe>> flails <<childhis>> legs and arms into the water trying to get free as you struggle to rub <<childhim>> properly. Water splashes quickly soak your clothes. <<childHe>> continues throwing a tantrum until the end of the bath, leaving you with a headache.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>
		<br><br>
		You finish bathing <<childhim>>, lay <<childhim>> on a towel, and dry <<childhis>> body with softer fabric. You finish by changing <<childhis>> nappy and putting <<childhim>> back in <<childhis>> crib.
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
	<<case "nappyChange">>
		<<wearProp "rag" "white">>
		<<childname>> looks uncomfortable. You notice a telling stink, so you fetch a nappy, and lay <<childhim>> flat. You remove the old nappy, and clean the <<childtype>>'s bottom diligently before giving <<childhim>> a fresh one. Clean and changed, <<childname>> looks up at you and smiles.<<lstress>><<stress -3>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
	<<case "crawlingAttempt">>
		You approach <<childname>>. <<childHe>> lies on <<childhis>> belly, trying to move <<childherself>>. You side beside <<childhim>>, and take <<childhis>> hands in your own, and hold them to the ground to give <<childhim>> leverage. With your help, <<childhe>> manages to pull <<childhimself>> across the floor, bewildered and amused by <<childhis>> mobility. <<childHe>> gets the hang of it after a while, and you leave <<childhim>> to clumsily crawl on <<childhis>> own.<<lstress>><<stress -6>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.crawling++>>
	<<case "crawlingAttempt2">>
		You take the <<childtype>>'s hands in your own, and hoist <<childhim>> up, leaving only <<childhis>> feet on the ground. <<childHe>>'s confused at first, flailing <<childhis>> legs until <<childhe>> snags the ground with a kick and propels <<childherself>> forwards. <<childHis>> eyes widen at the revelation, and soon enough, with some effort and failed attempts, you have <<childhim>> moving with <<childhis>> own legs. With your help keeping <<childhim>> upright, of course. <<childHe>> grows tired after a while, and you let <<childhim>> down again.<<llstress>><<stress -10>>
		<<set $children[$childActivityEvent.childid].localVariables.activity to "sleeping">>
	<<case "grumpyChild">>
		<<childname>> sits alone, wearing a scowl on <<childhis>> infant face. You sit beside <<childhim>>, but <<childhe>> ignores you. Unable to help but smile at the grumpy child's expression, you begin to tickle <<childhim>>. <<childHe>>'s not ticklish, but is amused by your teasing fingers and the silly noises you make as you playfully attack <<childhis>> sides. The scowl is soon gone, and <<childhe>> giggles and smiles instead. Mission accomplished.<<lstress>><<stress -6>>
